**Update v2.13.7**

- Refactored `query.skin_id` and `query.mark_variant` to new entity properties for Trainers, Pokemon, Pokestop, etc.
- Removed Hub NPC file, as it was causing unnecessary content errors (and was not being used)
- Updated crate texture names, to match the behavior pack.
- Removed broken texture setting in `block.json`
